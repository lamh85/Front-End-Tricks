Some front-end tricks that I learned from work and from personal projects _without using any UI libraries_

* A two-bordered avatar
* A slideshow that animates in intervals
* A loading animation that uses rotation animation
* Given an array of `div`s with varying heights, use Anglar's `ng-repeat` to keep each set of `div`s within the correct `.row` class.
